Welcome to the [TOPdesk](https://www.topdesk.com/) internationalization puzzles.

This is a series of **programming puzzles**. For each puzzle, write a program that analyzes the `input` file, and produces a result. Submit the result and find out immediately if you solved the puzzle correctly. Each puzzle introduces a new concept that has to do with internationalization. You will learn more and more as you go. 

Each puzzle includes a `test-input`, that is fully worked out with the answer given. If your program can give the correct answer on the test input, then it will usually work for the real input as well. 

You may use any programming language you like. You are encouraged to use libraries as much as possible (in fact, most challenges are hard to solve without some library). Each puzzle comes with a list of reading materials and online tools that can help you to understand the problem. You may use Google or Wikipedia to find more information - this is not an exam!

The puzzles should not be too hard. Most take less than 30 minutes for an experienced programmer. If it takes you more than 1 hour to solve, then let it go for a while and continue with the next puzzle. 

You find the list of puzzles below. Follow the progress of your colleagues on the [scoreboard](/scoreboard). Good luck!
