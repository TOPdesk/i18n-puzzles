== TOPdesk challenges in i18n and l11n ==

Welcome to the TOPdesk challenges in internationalization and localization.

This is a series of programming challenges. For each puzzle, you have to write a program that analyzes the given input file, and produces an answer. The answer always consists of a single exact number or string.

Each puzzle includes a test-input, that is fully worked out with the answer given. If your program can give the correct answer on the test input, then it will usually work for the real input as well. 

You may use any programming language you like. You are encouraged to use libraries as much as possible (in fact, most challenges are hard to solve without some library).

Here are the puzzles:

- [puzzle1](./puzzle1/README.md)
- [puzzle2](./puzzle2/README.md)
- [puzzle3](./puzzle3/README.md)
- [puzzle4](./puzzle4/README.md)
- More puzzles may be added in the future...
