# Challenges in i18n and l11n

Welcome to the [TOPdesk](https://www.topdesk.com/) challenges in internationalization and localization.

This is a series of programming challenges. For each puzzle, you have to write a program that analyzes the given input file, and produces an answer. The answer always consists of a single exact number or string. Each puzzle introduces a new concept that has to do with internationalization. You will learn more and more as you go. 

Each puzzle includes a test-input, that is fully worked out with the answer given. If your program can give the correct answer on the test input, then it will usually work for the real input as well. 

You may use any programming language you like. You are encouraged to use libraries as much as possible (in fact, most challenges are hard to solve without some library). You may use any online resources as much as you like, there is a useful reading list below.

The puzzles should not be too hard. Most take less than 10 minutes for an experienced programmer. If it takes you more than 1 hour to solve, then let it go for a while and continue with the next puzzle. 

You find the list of puzzles below. Follow the progress of your colleagues on the [scoreboard](/scoreboard). Good luck!
