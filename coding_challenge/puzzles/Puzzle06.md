## --- Unwrapping your present ---

After all the hard work of delivering the goodies to the offices, it's time to open your own present!

To make sure the presents for our programmers don't inadvertently get opened by any sales people, your present is equipped with a little check to prove that you are some kind of programmer.

You may only open your gift if you can solve a CAPTCHA so fast that no human brain could have solved it. To prove you used your coding power, you get only 1 millisecond to solve it.

The CAPTCHA requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and `find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list`. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

For example:

- 1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.
- 1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.
- 1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.
- 91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.
