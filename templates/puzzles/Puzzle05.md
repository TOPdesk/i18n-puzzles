## --- Get to the office ---

You're airdropped near the TOPdesk office in Budapest to start your presents delivery run. Unluckily, due to a strong headwind you've landed quite a way away from the mark.

We want to keep it a surprise that everybody is getting presents. To maintain secrecy, all our communication is obfuscated. You are given directions to the office, but you will have to decode them first.

The instruction indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where you just landed) and face North. Then, follow the provided sequence: either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of blocks, ending at a new intersection. Given that you can only walk on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the destination?

For example:

- Following R2, L3 leaves you 2 blocks East and 3 blocks North, or 5 blocks away.
- R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks due South of your starting position, which is 2 blocks away.
- R5, L5, R5, R3 leaves you 12 blocks away.

`How many blocks away is the TOPdesk office?`
